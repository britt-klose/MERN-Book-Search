  ## Description
  The MERN book search application is a perfect example of how to convert a platform from using node, express, and the typical route set up; to using an Appollo Server and GraphQL queries and mutations. The application works the same either way, but this repository allows coders to see the many differences on the front and back end. View the files in both the server and client folders. You will see some files have been fully commented out like the routes and controllers files in the server side. The files have been left to view the transition to graphql. Additionally in other files you'll see some code snippets commented out. Most of which are regarding imports from queries.js and mutations.js versus the RESTFUL API. Take a look for yourself and see what's there!
